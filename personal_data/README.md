Log message obfuscation refers to the practice of masking or encrypting sensitive information in log messages to protect it from unauthorized access or exposure.

The re.sub() function in Python is used for performing regular expression-based substitutions in a given string.

re.sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)

pattern : The regular expression pattern to search for in the string.
repl: The replacement string to substitute for the matched pattern.
string: The input string in which the substitutions will be made.
count (optional): The maximum number of replacements to make. If omitted or set to 0, all occurrences will be replaced.
flags (optional): Flags that modify the behavior of the search. For example, re.IGNORECASE can be used to perform case-insensitive matching.
